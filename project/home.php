        <p>I joined sahydri trekkers about a year ago. I’ve been very impressed with the focus on training: not just destination or supplier trainings, but trainings on all aspects of being a travel advisor. The support from Fora HQ for all advisors to help make us more successful is INCREDIBLE. From Marketing support to guidance on Content creation to the very engaged Community of Fora Advisors, it has been an incredible experience. The HQ team keeps investing in a tech forward approach to make life for the advisors much easier and more productive. Thank you FORA HQ! Highly recommend FORA travel!</p>

        <p>I started with Fora in Oct 2023 and booked $120k in travel in just 3 months. Honestly I had absolutely no experience in travel aside from booking trips for my family. I thought it would be a good way to get a little extra income but knew nothing about the industry. Fora gave me every training I could ever need so I feel comfortable booking hotels, cruises, all inclusives. I have been very impressed not only by the training but the support and community. As a total newbie I was worried I wouldn't know what to do but now between the training
        and support, feel totally confident that no matter what I come across, someone at Fora can help me.</p>

        <p>I am a huge fan of all things Fora! Having recently joined Fora from another host agency, I can't even tell you how blown away I am with Fora's level of support and engagement from the HQ and Founder level. My experience with Fora is truly unparalleled and much appreciated! There are a plethora of resources to assist you to be a better Advisor to make the best recommendations for your clients, plus an amazing community of fellow advisors that supports you at every turn! I can't speak more highly of my experience thus far and in 
        turn have only had happy clients!</p>

        <p>I was just certified with Fora and I am having the best experience so far! This is a true community-oriented setup that I foresee being extremely helpful as I grow in my experience as an advisor. The HQ staff is extremely helpful and available, providing plenty of learning opportunity and encouraging togetherness among advisors to 
        help each other along in our journeys.</p>

        <p>I joined FORA in late
        2023 as a side hustle. Given that this is my first time working within the travel industry, I have been thoroughly impressed by the training they provide their advisors. Everything proceeds at your own pace and there are multiple avenues to engage in training (live workshops, online modules, virtual topic-specific office hours, etc.).
    The FORA team also values community amongst advisors, which is demonstrated through online forums, organized site inspections and other networking opportunities. They want their advisors to have what they need to be successful 
    and even go so far as to provide marketing support/assets for a 
    variety of platforms.I would recommend FORA to anyone who has a passion for the travel industry, especially if you're a first timer looking to get your foot in the door. The resources available have made it possible for me to build my own business while still having a full time job.</p>
